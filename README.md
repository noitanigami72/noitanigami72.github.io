## About me

Since I much care about the overall quality around me, in Software Quality Assurance 
I've found finally my way of life, satisfaction of giving the best of me.
Now in 2025 it's been 4 years that I conduct both manual and automatic tests, in teams and on my own.
I have a quality-oriented analytical mindset with the strong drive to deliver great software.

## My sandbox

I have my own working domain [apptesting.pl](https://apptesting.pl/) with several apps installed to conduct various kinds of testing on them. This allows me to
step out of the comfort zone of relatively simple tasks described in various tutorials and courses and work solely upon the documentation, simulate complex issues, etc.
To date the following are available:
* [PrestaShop](https://apptesting.pl/quadpresta/)
* [OpenCart](https://apptesting.pl/opencart/)
* [JCow Group Work](https://apptesting.pl/jcow/)
* [Mantis](https://apptesting.pl/mantis/)
* [Kanboard](https://apptesting.pl/kanboard/)


## Professional Courses 
* [QA Bootcamp](https://szkoleniedlaqa.pl/szkolenie) – a solid theoretical and practical foundation that allowed me to kickstart the QA work.
